    "# Introduction to the UR5e :)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **UR5e** is a robot arm from Universal Robots that we are using to perform cello bowings. This robot is easy to use and program, but you will need to pay close attention as you go through the Universal Robots courses. This is so you can ensure proper **safety** at all times when using the robot cello. \n",
    "\n",
    "Upon completion of this notebook and the completion of the [course on the Universal Robots website](https://academy.universal-robots.com/free-e-learning/e-series-e-learning/) (I will describe in greater detail below), you will be asked to complete both an in-person and an [online safety quiz](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdqyVrG2GFoYNl0ypNZOShCEf2TrchZ00XjbQf9NRWCbdGMDQ/viewform?usp=header) to ensure that you have properly leared the material and can effectively operate the robot in a safe manner. \n",
    "\n",
    "Send me an email at ssudhoff@purdue.edu once you have completed this notebook **and** the online safety quiz, and we can set a time for your in-person safety quiz. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's get into basic controls! \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Control of the UR5e \n",
    "\n",
    "We currently control the UR5e using:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **URScript**: A scripting language that allows us to send motion commands directly to the robot.\n",
    "- **RTDE (Real-Time Data Exchange)**: A Python-based protocol that allows real-time control and logging of the robot's state.\n",
    "- **Waypoints**: We define fixed poses for each cello string (A, D, G, C), and command the robot to move linearly between those poses to simulate bowing.\n",
    "- **Custom Python Scripts**: We run motion control logic that determines bow direction (up/down), duration, and string switching behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code which we are using to control the robot can be found [here](https://github.com/srs827/Robot-Cello), and I suggest going through the \"song.script\" code (which is the URScript we send to the robot to control it) as well as the Python script \"robot-control.py\", which generates the URScript to be sent to the robot and sets up the RTDE data gathering. If you do not already have access to this repository, please send me your GitHub username through Teams or through email. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a brief summary of our basic controls, we generate notes based on a MIDI file, and these notes are translated into a sequence of movements that get sent to the robot, and then the robot plays these notes. Let me know if you have more questions, and I can walk you through the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "To learn how to properly control the robot, take the following courses on the Universal Robotics website: [courses on the Universal Robotics website:](https://academy.universal-robots.com/free-e-learning/e-series-e-learning/). You will want to do the **e-Series Core Track** and the **e-Series Pro Track**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, review the [UR5e User Manual](https://www.universal-robots.com/download/manuals-e-seriesur20ur30/user/ur5e/57/user-manual-ur5e-e-series-sw-57-english-us-en-us/) which contains important safety information that you will need for the safety test. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional Resources:**\n",
    " To learn about URScript Programming: [URScript Manual](https://www.universal-robots.com/download/manuals-e-seriesur20ur30/script/script-manual-e-series-sw-512/)\n",
    " To learn about data logging: [RTDE Guide](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=RTDE+guide&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) \n",

    "## RL and LSTM-based Control\n",
    "\n",
    "Another major aspect of the robot cello project is robot learning, where we are integrating **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** and **LSTM**. The main goal of the robot learning portion is to smooth out the robot's motions when switching between strings, and to create \"smarter\" bowings. I won't go in-depth here about all of the specifics, but it is important that you learn the basics about what Reinforcement Learning and LSTMs are so that you can understand this portion of the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "To learn about these concepts, please review the following courses: \n",
    "- [Hugging Face Course: Reinforcement Learning](https://huggingface.co/learn/deep-rl-course/unit0/introduction)\n",
    "- [MIT OpenCourseWare: An Introduction to LSTMs with TensorFlow](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/res-9-008-brain-and-cognitive-sciences-computational-tutorials/pages/9-an-introduction-to-lstms-in-tensorflow/)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note for RL:** I recommend going through all of the units, but there is no need to do the bonus/optional units. Pay special attention to **Unit 8: Proximal Policy Optimization**, as this is what we will be using. You don't need to complete **all** the exercises in the course, as it is quite lengthy, but you do need to come away from the course with a basic understanding of RL and PPO. \n",

    "- Define a reward function that rewards minimizing distance to the target\n",
    "- Implement a PPO agent using `stable-baselines3`\n",
    "- Train the agent until it reliably reaches the target\n",

    "### Questions to Answer (in a markdown cell)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How did you define the state and action spaces?\n",
    "2. What reward function did you use? How did it impact learning?\n",
    "3. Did the policy converge? How many episodes did it take?\n",
    "4. What would change in a real UR5e cello bowing task?\n",
