# robot-cello-summer25

Hi everyone! This page is dedicated to on-boarding new members and providing a way to get integrated into the project as quickly and easily as possible.

You may select to complete Option 1 (UR5e + RL) or Option 2 (Baxter Robot + ROS) depending on which part of the project you wish to focus on this summer.
1) UR5e Programming, Safety, and Control (Option 1)
2) Reinforcement Learing (Option 1)
3) Baxter Robot (Option 2)
4) ROS (Option 2) 


Option 1
___________

For those of you that select to work with the UR5e, you will be focused on improving robot motion through Reinforcement Learning. 
The focus of this project is developing a Robotic Cellist which can sight-read new muic. The benefit of selecting option 1 comes with 
having a much larger number of resources available both online and through previous members of the project to assist with your work. The UR5e is easily
programmable, and intuitive to use. However, option 1 has less flexibility than option 2 on what you can work on, and it is leess open-ended. 


Option 2
__________

For those of you that select to work with the Baxter robot, the initial idea is to play the drums, but there is room for creativity. 
The main challenge with this robot is that documentation is sparse, and this robot must be controlled using ROS (i.e. it is much harder to control than the UR5e). 
Since this portion of the project is new, you will have to try many things and explore. 
Another potential application is through Human-Robot interaction, as this robot has cameras, facial expressions, and is safe to use around humans.
